## TO DO LIST.
### Full Stack Web Application.

The purpose of this project is to show the process of developing a *Full Stack Web Application* that uses the MVC architecture. It showcases a **TO DO LIST** web app where users can save, view, update and delete tasks that they need to do in the future. 

* #### Front End ####
**React JavaScript web application** that communicates with the Back End by performing all the CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete). This application serves as the *View* component in the MVC model. 

[**Front End** details.](https://github.com/hjorozco/to-do-list-full-stack-application/tree/main/to-do-list-front-end) 

* #### Back End ####
The Back End consists of two parts: 

1. **Java Spring based application** that servers as the *Controller* component of the MVC model by accepting HTTP requests from the *View* component and converting them to commands for the *Model*, then sending data back to the *View* for it to display.

2. ***MySQL database*** that servers as the *Model* component of the MVC architecture by providing a dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.
